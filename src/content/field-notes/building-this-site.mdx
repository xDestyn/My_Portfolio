# Building This Site

I wanted a personal site that felt genuinely mine—not a template, not a LinkedIn clone, just a digital space that captures how I think about code and creativity.

## The Vision

Most portfolios feel like resumes with extra steps. I wanted something different:

- **Interactive, not static**: Command palette for terminal lovers
- **Living content**: Field Notes as a blog that's actually maintained
- **Technically interesting**: Smooth animations, magnetic buttons, thoughtful interactions
- **Authentically me**: Personal voice, real projects, honest reflections

## The Tech

I kept the stack simple but modern:

- React + Vite for fast development
- Tailwind CSS for rapid styling
- Framer Motion for buttery animations
- MDX for content that's easy to write

The command palette was the most fun to build. It's functional (you can actually navigate), accessible (keyboard friendly), and aesthetically on-brand (terminal vibes).

## Lessons Learned

**Don't over-engineer**: I almost added React Three Fiber for a 3D hero element. Stopped myself. The site didn't need it.

**Motion matters**: The difference between a good animation and a great one is in the easing curves and timing. Spent way too long tweaking spring physics.

**Content is king**: All the tech in the world doesn't matter if you don't have something interesting to say.

## What's Next

More Field Notes, obviously. I want to document:

- Recent food trips
- Lessons from debugging production issues
- Random shower thoughts about software

The site will evolve. That's the point.
